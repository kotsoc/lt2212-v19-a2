# LT2212 V19 Assignment 2

From Asad Sayeed's statistical NLP course at the University of Gothenburg.

My name: Konstantinos Peratinos

## Additional instructions

Only meaningful additional information is that result.txt files contain two extra lines of information
before every matrix. A line with the class of the folder and a line with the ammount of lines that the matrix
takes. This was done in order to parse it succesfully with simdoc

## File naming convention

Files were names resultX.txt where X is the question number

## Results and discussion
Simdoc need a bit of finetuning to function for uneven matrixes but i ran out of time

### Vocabulary restriction.

Well i did not think of it excessively just chose a shortened vocabulary of -B = 40

### Result table

File names | Grain-Grain  | Crude-Crude| Crude-Grain | Grain-Crude 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
result1.txt|-|-|-|-             ## Could not calculate due to different dimensions of the classes
result2.txt|0.297|0.396|0.162|0.162
result3.txt|-|-|-|-             ## Could not calculate due to different dimensions of the classese  
result4.txt|0.226|0.248|0.171|0.171
result5.txt|0.214|0.270|0.056|0.052
result6.txt|-|-|-|-             ## Could not calculate due to different dimensions of the classes
result7.txt|0.094|0.097|0.092|0.092
result8.txt|0.11|0.10|0.07|0.07  ## Could not calculate due to different dimensions of the classes truncating to 1000 did not make them uniform

### The hypothesis in your own words

### Discussion of trends in results in light of the hypothesis
