## Additional instructions

Only meaningful additional information is that result.txt files contain two extra lines of information
before every matrix. A line with the class of the folder and a line with the ammount of lines that the matrix
takes. This was done in order to parse it succesfully with simdoc

## File naming convention

Files were names resultX.txt where X is the question number
